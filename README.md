**Rock, Paper, Scissors!** is a web app in which you can test your abilities in jokenp√¥ against the machine. It simulates the game by letting the user choose an input and automatically triggering the game logic to pick the computer's choice and determine the winner. See if you can win against the machine and have fun!

This project was built as an assignment for the Codecademy Front-End Engineer career path and aims to put into practice concepts of **CSS**, **React**, **Redux** and asynchronous functions as a training method. It was also deployed using **Netlify** and can be accessed at Rock, Paper, Scissors!

### :construction: Built With :construction:

* [![Vite][vite-badge]][vite-url] - Used as a build tool to help development.
* [![React][react-badge]][react-url] - Used to help implement the project as a single-page application and to create and manage the app components.
* [![Redux][redux-badge]][redux-url] - Used to manage and centralize the app states, implemented as a `Game` slice that holds the game phase and both the player's and the computer's choices.
